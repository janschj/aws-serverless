# aws-serverless-jersey-example
A basic example AWS Serverless Java container application written with the [Jersey framework] (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-java-container). The `LambdaHandler` object is the main entry point for Lambda. The application can be deployed in an AWS account using the [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). The `app-sam.yaml` file in the root folder contains the application definition.

The application is meant to be deployed as part of an automated CI/CD pipeline inspired from [this example] (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/continuous-deployment-for-serverless-applications/). This allows for a fully automated pipeline with multiple stages including build and integration tests as well as support for environment variables for full flexibility.

There are two separate parts to this application: the api and the pipeline which detects, builds, and deploys changes.
